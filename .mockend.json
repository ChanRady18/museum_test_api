        "content": "Early in the seventh century a new Buddha type appeared in Southeast Asia, inspired by innovations that were taking place in northern India. The wellspring was the important monastic school at Sarnath. Its workshops undoubtedly supplied Buddha images to a great variety of clients, including pilgrim-monks who would have purchased small images\u2014often, one may surmise, made of wood\u2014easily transportable to their homelands. This Buddha, slender and ethereal, is a superb example of the early acceptance of the northern Indian model of ideal Buddhahood, seen in the increasingly detached and otherworldly expression and the use of body-defining drapery.",

        "content": "This representation of Brahma, the Brahmanical god of creation and ancestor of all universes, is understood to be omnipresent. Hence he is depicted with four faces and four arms, evoking his universality. Brahma\u2019s skirt-cloth (sampot) is in the Bakheng style, widely favored in the early tenth century and named after sculptures associated with the Bakheng temple. It is knee length, is drawn up between the legs and secured at the back, and has distinctive pleated \u201cdouble-anchor,\u201d or \u201cfishtail,\u201d pendants in front. The piled-up dreadlock hair (jatamukuta) is multifaceted to reflect the four faces it serves, and is secured with a string of pearls; each face of Brahma wears a large diadem, and a speckled treatment of the lower face indicates that he is bearded. This sculpture would have occupied a subsidiary shrine at a temple complex dedicated in all likelihood to Shiva.",

        "content": "Ganesha is the Hindu elephant-headed deity who removes obstacles and is thus the god of success; in this sense, he is a god of great importance for everyday existence. He was venerated first, before the worshipper turned to the other gods, in order to remove potential obstacles between the worshipper and the divine. In Southeast Asia, Ganesha has a more independent status than in India; his images were often housed in separate temples as primary icons of worship. Here, Ganesha is shown wearing a short wraparound skirt (sampot), the front end of which falls down the center in a series of flaring folds characteristic of the Prasat Andet style.",

        "content": "Sculptures of Shiva in human form began to appear in Khmer art in the seventh century, probably in response to the rising popularity of the Vaishnava cult that celebrated Vishnu as a king-like divinity, accessible and benign. The slim, almost adolescent figure displays a disconcerting realism in the modeling of the pectoral muscles and the subtle suggestion of the underlying ribcage. Yet the face is strong and authoritative\u2014the face of a stern god\u2014with a mustache, full lips, and strong arched eyebrows. A vertical third eye marks the forehead.",

This temple was likely the earliest step-pyramid temple in Khmer history. It has two doorjamb inscriptions, dated 674 and 704, respectively. During excavations in the 1930s, a set of bronzes was found secreted away in a cavity behind a lintel. This bronze is probably from the same workshop that supplied the Prasat Ak Yom temple with its images.",

It depicts what must be assumed was the seated Buddha in deep meditation, resting on the coils of a snake that raises its seven-headed hood above the Buddha\u2019s head. The cult of the animistic naga (snake-serpent) is an ancient practice in India and was readily taken up in Angkorian Cambodia to reflect a meeting of Indic and local cults that acknowledge the power of snake-spirits.",

The Bayon, sited at the very center of Angkor Thom, was one of the last major monuments of the Khmer empire.\n\nThis sculpture is fragmentary. The top head is missing.

There are three types of monastic robes: under garment (sampot ngout), the robe that covers the shoulder (sometimes the shoulders) uttarasanga called (cheipor), the robe covering the lower part of the body from the hips antaravasaka called (sbang). The uttarasanga can be worn in two ways: the left shoulder is bare in the \u2018krang\u2019 style and the both shoulders are covered in the \u2018khlum\u2019 style.",

Some statues were inlaid in the eye cavities with precious stones to make them more life-like. The art of inlay was undeniably widespread throughout Southeast Asia in the 11th century.\nThis reclining Visnu is testimony to the talent of Khmer artists in the production of monumental bronze statues.
